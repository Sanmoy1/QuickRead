- **Sign Up**: New users can create an account by providing an email and password.
- **Login**: Existing users can log in to their accounts.
- **Logout**: Users can log out, which clears their authentication state.

### Setup Instructions
1. **Firebase Configuration**: Ensure you have configured your Firebase project and added the necessary configurations in your Flutter app.
2. **Dependencies**: The following dependencies are required for Firebase authentication:
   - `firebase_auth`: ^5.3.4
   - `firebase_core`: ^3.8.1
3. **Authentication Flow**: The authentication flow is managed through the `AuthProvider` class, which handles sign-in, sign-up, and sign-out operations.

## üèó Architecture

The application follows the **MVVM (Model-View-ViewModel)** architecture pattern, enhanced by the **Provider** package for state management. This structure promotes a clear separation of concerns:

- **Model**: Represents data structures and business logic (e.g., `Article`, `SearchFilters`, `NewsService`).
- **View**: Comprises UI components that display data and interact with users (e.g., `HomeScreen`, `ArticleDetailsScreen`).
- **ViewModel**: Managed by the `Provider`, it holds the app's state and business logic, notifying the View of any changes (e.g., `NewsProvider`, `SearchHistoryProvider`).

This architecture enables reactive programming, allowing the UI to automatically update in response to state changes, making the app scalable and maintainable.
